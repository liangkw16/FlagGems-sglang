# Contributing a New Operator

Thanks for your interest in `flaggems_sglang`. This guide walks through the
full lifecycle of shipping a new operator: deciding where it lives, wiring it
into the multi-level dispatcher, adding tests and benchmarks, meeting the code
style requirements, and getting it through CI.

If you're integrating a whole new hardware vendor rather than a single
operator, start with
[`src/flaggems_sglang/runtime/backend/README.md`](../src/flaggems_sglang/runtime/backend/README.md)
first — it covers vendor bring-up. Come back here once you have a vendor
folder in place.

---

## 1. Pick the right layer

Operators are resolved through a three-level registrar
(`runtime/op_registrar.py`). Later levels override earlier ones on name
collision:

| Priority | Location                                            | Purpose                       |
|----------|-----------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| 0        | `src/flaggems_sglang/ops/`                          | Generic Triton fallback       |
| 1        | `src/flaggems_sglang/runtime/backend/_<vendor>/ops/`| Per-vendor specialization     |
| 2        | `src/flaggems_sglang/runtime/backend/_<vendor>/<arch>/ops/` | Per-arch specialization |

Use this decision tree:

- **New op that any Triton-capable device can run** → put it under
  `src/flaggems_sglang/ops/`. This is the default.
- **Vendor-specific rewrite of an existing op** (e.g. leveraging a vendor
  intrinsic, or working around a compiler quirk) → put it under
  `runtime/backend/_<vendor>/ops/`.
- **Arch-specific rewrite** (e.g. Hopper WGMMA path vs. Ampere) → put it
  under `runtime/backend/_<vendor>/<arch>/ops/`.

Routing is by **function name**, not import path. A vendor override for
`gemma_rms_norm` simply defines `def gemma_rms_norm(...)` in
`_<vendor>/ops/gemma_rms_norm.py` and re-exports it via that folder's
`ops/__init__.py`. Missing operators fall back to the generic implementation
automatically, so vendors only ship what they specialize.

---

## 2. Add the operator

The examples below assume a new op called `my_op`.

### 2.1 Generic implementation

Create `src/flaggems_sglang/ops/my_op.py`:

```python
# Copyright 2026 FlagOS Contributors
# ... (Apache 2.0 header — see any existing file)

import torch
import triton
import triton.language as tl


@triton.jit
def _my_op_kernel(...):
    ...


def my_op(x: torch.Tensor, ...) -> torch.Tensor:
    """One-line summary. Extend if the shape/dtype contract is non-obvious."""
    ...
    return out


__all__ = ["my_op"]
```

Rules:

- **Every op file must define `__all__`.** The registrar walks `__all__` to
  discover public entry points; anything not listed is invisible.
- **File name should match the primary op name** (`my_op.py` exports `my_op`).
  It is what CI's `tools/select_tests.py` uses to auto-select the matching
  test and benchmark files.
- **Include the Apache 2.0 copyright header** at the top of every source
  file. Copy it verbatim from an existing file.
- Prefer `torch.Tensor` type hints on the public signature; keep the
  Triton kernel as a private `_` -prefixed function.
- Do not import from `runtime.backend.*` inside a generic op — the whole
  point of the generic tier is that it's device-agnostic.

### 2.2 Vendor specialization

Create `src/flaggems_sglang/runtime/backend/_<vendor>/ops/my_op.py` with the
same function name and the same `__all__ = ["my_op"]` contract as a generic
op. The registrar walks every `*.py` in the vendor `ops/` package the same
way it walks the generic tier — you do **not** need to re-export from
`_<vendor>/ops/__init__.py`.

### 2.3 Arch specialization

Same idea, one level deeper:
`_<vendor>/<arch>/ops/my_op.py`. `<arch>` is resolved via the vendor's
`ARCH_MAP` (see `_nvidia/__init__.py`). Again: the op file's `__all__` is
what gets discovered; the `ops/__init__.py` at this tier does not need any
re-export.

### 2.4 Verify the registration

After the op is in place, from a Python shell:

```python
import flaggems_sglang
assert "my_op" in flaggems_sglang.all_registered_ops()
print(flaggems_sglang.my_op.__module__)  # confirms which tier resolved
```

---

## 3. Add tests

Every new op needs a correctness test at `tests/test_my_op.py`. The filename
must match the source stem so CI picks it up automatically.

Skeleton — mirror an existing test like `tests/test_gemma_rms_norm.py`:

```python
# Copyright 2026 FlagOS Contributors
# ... (Apache 2.0 header)

import pytest
import torch

import flaggems_sglang
from . import conftest as cfg

FLOAT_DTYPES = [torch.float16, torch.bfloat16]
SHAPES = [(1, 512), (4, 1024), (32, 2048)]


def _ref_my_op(x, ...):
    """Reference implementation — prefer sgl_kernel or a torch equivalent."""
    ...


@pytest.mark.parametrize("shape", SHAPES)
@pytest.mark.parametrize("dtype", FLOAT_DTYPES)
@pytest.mark.my_op
def test_my_op(shape, dtype):
    device = cfg.device
    x = torch.randn(*shape, dtype=dtype, device=device)

    ref = _ref_my_op(x)
    res = flaggems_sglang.my_op(x)

    atol = 1e-2 if dtype == torch.float16 else 5e-3
    torch.testing.assert_close(res, ref, atol=atol, rtol=1e-2)
```

Guidelines:

- **Reference correctness against an established implementation** — prefer
  `sgl_kernel` when available (as `test_gemma_rms_norm.py` does), otherwise
  a torch reference. Do not compare against your own kernel.
- **Tag each test with `@pytest.mark.<op_name>`.** Markers are used to
  select subsets in CI and locally.
- **Cover the dtypes and shape regimes the op actually targets.** For hidden
  dims, at minimum cover a small, a medium, and a large shape.
- **Tolerances should match dtype.** `1e-2` for fp16, `5e-3` for bf16 is a
  reasonable default for norm-shaped ops; adjust per numerics.
- **Do not gate on GPU-specific features** in the generic test — the same
  test runs across every vendor's runner.

Run it locally:

```shell
pytest -q tests/test_my_op.py --quick
```

---

## 4. Add a benchmark

Every new op also gets a perf benchmark at `benchmark/test_my_op.py`. Mirror
`benchmark/test_gemma_rms_norm.py`:

```python
# Copyright 2026 FlagOS Contributors
# ... (Apache 2.0 header)

import pytest
import torch

import flaggems_sglang
from .attri_util import FLOAT_DTYPES, MY_OP_BENCH_SHAPES


@pytest.mark.parametrize("shape", MY_OP_BENCH_SHAPES)
@pytest.mark.parametrize("dtype", FLOAT_DTYPES)
@pytest.mark.my_op
def test_my_op(shape, dtype, benchmark):
    device = flaggems_sglang.device
    x = torch.randn(*shape, dtype=dtype, device=device)
    benchmark(flaggems_sglang.my_op, x)
```

Add your shape list (`MY_OP_BENCH_SHAPES`) to `benchmark/attri_util.py`, next
to the existing per-op shape constants. Pick shapes representative of the
serving scenarios the op is designed for (decode vs. prefill, typical hidden
dims for target models).

Run locally:

```shell
pytest -q benchmark/test_my_op.py --level core --iter 1 --warmup 1
```

---

## 5. Code style

The full style contract lives in `.pre-commit-config.yaml` and `.flake8`.
Summary:

- **Formatter: `black`, line length 79.**
- **Import sort: `isort` with `--profile black`, line length 80.**
- **Linter: `flake8`, max line 79, extend-ignore `E203`** (pre-commit also
  ignores `F405,E731,W503,E203,E704` at 120 cols — but keep new code within
  the 79-col black limit).
- **Trailing whitespace and end-of-file newlines** are enforced by
  pre-commit hooks.
- **Apache 2.0 copyright header** is required on every new `.py`, `.yaml`,
  and `.md` file. Copy it from an existing file — the CI style job will
  fail otherwise.

Install and run pre-commit once per clone:

```shell
pip install pre-commit
pre-commit install
pre-commit run --all-files
```

Additional conventions from the existing codebase:

- Public function signatures use `torch.Tensor` type hints where meaningful.
- Prefix Triton `@triton.jit` kernels with `_` — they are implementation
  detail, not part of the public API.
- Docstrings are short; add a paragraph only when the tuning story or an
  invariant would surprise a future reader.
- Don't add comments that describe *what* the code does — well-named
  identifiers already do that. Add a comment only when the *why* is
  non-obvious (a hidden constraint, a workaround, a chosen tradeoff).

---

## 6. CI

CI runs on every push and PR to `master` (`.github/workflows/basic-ci.yml`).
There are three stages:

1. **`code-style`** — runs `pre-commit run --all-files` on Ubuntu. Fails on
   any formatter, linter, or copyright-header issue. Passing this locally
   before pushing saves a round trip.
2. **`select-targets`** — runs `tools/select_tests.py` against the diff to
   pick the minimal set of tests and benchmarks impacted by your change.
   The selector matches source files to tests **by stem**
   (`src/.../ops/my_op.py` → `tests/test_my_op.py` and
   `benchmark/test_my_op.py`). Sticking to the naming convention above is
   what makes automatic selection work.
3. **`nvidia-tests`** — runs the selected tests (`pytest --quick`) and
   benchmarks (`pytest --level core`) on the NVIDIA runner. Benchmark
   output is posted back to the PR.

Additional runners (AMD, Ascend, Iluvatar, Kunlunxin, Metax, Mthreads,
Hygon, T-Head) may be attached to your PR depending on vendor coverage. If
your change is vendor-specific, note in the PR description which runners
should exercise it.

**How to keep CI happy:**

- Keep filenames aligned (`my_op.py` ↔ `test_my_op.py` ↔
  `benchmark/test_my_op.py`).
- Don't add heavy imports at module top-level that require a specific
  vendor SDK — CI style runs on plain Ubuntu with no GPU.
- New pytest markers (`@pytest.mark.my_op`) don't need registration;
  `pytest.ini` sets `filterwarnings = ignore::pytest.PytestUnknownMarkWarning`.
- If your op requires a new Python dependency, add it to `pyproject.toml`
  and call it out in the PR description — CI runners have preconfigured
  venvs that may need refreshing.

## 7. Opening the PR

Use the template at `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`. Fill in:

- **Header** - Each file must contain a copyright notice comment. The last line "Generated by XXX" is optional.
```

#
# Generated by XXX
```
- **PR Category** — pick from `Operator | OP Test | Model Test | Benchmark |
  CI/CD | User Experience | Other`. A new op typically touches
  `Operator + OP Test + Benchmark`.
- **Type of Change** — `New Feature`, `Performance Optimization`, etc.
- **Description** — what the op does, what tier it targets (generic / vendor
  / arch), and any calling convention notes.
- **Issue** — link the tracking issue if there is one.
- **Progress checklist** — tests, review, coverage.
- **Performance** — if it's a perf change, paste the before/after benchmark
  numbers for the shapes your op cares about.

Reviewer expectations:

- At least 1 reviewer; 2 recommended.
- Every change is covered by at least one unit test.
- For perf work, include benchmark deltas in the PR body.
- Push to a topic branch, not `master`.

---

## 8. Quick checklist

Before you hit "Create PR":

- [ ] Op file has Apache 2.0 header and defines `__all__`.
- [ ] File name matches op name (`my_op.py` exports `my_op`).
- [ ] Op appears in `flaggems_sglang.all_registered_ops()` locally.
- [ ] `tests/test_my_op.py` exists, references a trusted baseline, is
      tagged with `@pytest.mark.my_op`.
- [ ] `benchmark/test_my_op.py` exists with representative shapes added to
      `benchmark/attri_util.py`.
- [ ] `pre-commit run --all-files` passes.
- [ ] `pytest -q tests/test_my_op.py --quick` passes on your device.
- [ ] For vendor/arch specializations: op file defines
      `__all__ = ["<op_name>"]`.
- [ ] PR description follows the template.

## 9. FlagOS × SGLang competition submissions

Submissions for the **FlagOS × SGLang** operator competition follow a
lighter-weight process than a full contribution — competitors ship the
operator only, and the maintainers handle correctness and performance
validation against a held-out harness.

**What you submit:**

- The operator source file, in the correct tier of the dispatcher tree.
  Same rules as §1 and §2:
  - Generic Triton kernel → `src/flaggems_sglang/ops/<op_name>.py`.
  - Vendor-specialized → `src/flaggems_sglang/runtime/backend/_<vendor>/ops/<op_name>.py`.
  - Arch-specialized → `src/flaggems_sglang/runtime/backend/_<vendor>/<arch>/ops/<op_name>.py`.
- Every op file defines `__all__ = ["<op_name>"]`. The registrar picks up
  every tier by walking the corresponding `ops/` package and reading each
  module's `__all__` — no `ops/__init__.py` re-export needed at any tier.
- The Apache 2.0 copyright header on every new file.

**What you do *not* need to submit:**

- No `tests/test_<op_name>.py`.
- No `benchmark/test_<op_name>.py` or shape constants in
  `benchmark/attri_util.py`.
- No PR-description performance numbers — the competition harness collects
  them centrally.

**What still must pass:**

Even without tests and benchmarks, competition PRs go through the same
`basic-ci.yml` pipeline. That means:

- **Signing the CLA is mandatory in order to submit code to this repository.**
- **`code-style` must pass.** Run `pre-commit run --all-files` locally
  before pushing — the Apache header, `black` (line 79), `isort`
  (`--profile black`), and `flake8` checks are all mandatory.
- **The op must import cleanly.** After your change,
  `import flaggems_sglang` should succeed and
  `flaggems_sglang.all_registered_ops()` should list your op. If it
  doesn't, `select-targets` won't pick anything up and the maintainers
  can't score your submission.
- **`select-targets` and downstream jobs must not error out.** Since you
  aren't adding a `test_<op>.py`, the selector will report no impacted
  tests and the vendor test job will be skipped — that is expected and
  fine. What must *not* happen is a syntax error or an import failure at
  package load time, which would fail every job.

**Competition-flavored PR description:**

Use the standard template at `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`, and in the
**Description** section clearly state:

- That this is a **FlagOS × SGLang competition** submission.
- The **operator name** and the **tier** it targets
  (generic / vendor `_<vendor>` / arch `_<vendor>/<arch>`).
- The **target hardware** (vendor + arch) it was tuned for.
- Any calling-convention or dtype constraints the scoring harness needs
  to know about.
- **Accuracy Tests** is optional
- **Speed Tests and Profiling** results are from the submission system. You just copy the results and paste them here.

**Competition checklist:**

- [ ] Op file lives in the correct dispatcher tier folder.
- [ ] Apache 2.0 header + `__all__` present.
- [ ] For vendor/arch tiers: op file defines
      `__all__ = ["<op_name>"]`.
- [ ] `import flaggems_sglang; flaggems_sglang.all_registered_ops()`
      shows your op locally.
- [ ] `pre-commit run --all-files` passes.
- [ ] PR description tags this as a competition submission and names the
      target hardware.
